# chainheroes
Initial implementation of chainheroes, a tamagotchi inspired game living on ETH mainnet

The goal is to create a tamagotchi inspired game in which the assets are ERC721 NFTs living on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The "base" asset will live on the blockchain, while several off-chain mechanics will be set in place to further grow the "asset". 
Daily tasks such as sending them out for exploration, feeding them fodder, and training them.
